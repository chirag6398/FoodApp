# Overview

The food app with a multitenant architecture is designed to cater to multiple brands and their outlets with a single login page. The app allows superadmins to create and manage multiple brands within the platform. Brands, in turn, can create products across multiple categories, subcategories, and outlets. Outlets have the option to create outlet agents who can place orders on behalf of customers, providing both dine-in and take-away options.
